"""Build docs/onthisday.json — a compact "This Day in DCI History" index.

Keyed by "MM-DD" → up to 6 notable entries drawn from every season's events on
that calendar day, ranked so the biggest moments (World Championship Finals,
then highest scores) come first. Static history; regenerate after a season
ends or a backfill lands new seasons (the app reads it as committed — the
data pipeline never rebuilds it). Reads docs/data/seasons/*.json, writes
docs/onthisday.json (NOT docs/data/ — that dir is wiped every build)."""
